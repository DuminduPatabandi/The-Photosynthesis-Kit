# The-Photosynthesis-Kit
Idea about a kit that can produce energy on its own and supply to humans


We need food to live. Each and every day we eat, drink various kinds of foods to
maintain our life, but what if the food comes to an end. With the increasing population food consumption has grown high, so what if all the foods we eat comes to their end or finding food is rare.
There must be a solution. Huhâ€¦
This is the Photosynthesis kit. The kit which can produce food and energy on its own. Yup like a tree, but with some fashion.

So as plants, this kit is able to convert sunlight into energy (ATP) and food.
(Liquidized food to be more precise.)
The kit is integrated with billions of synthetic photosynthesis cells and each cell will convert sunlight to energy by absorbing humidity  and  it will transfer to an injecting mechanism.
And excess glucose and minerals will collect to the bottle as a consumable liquid connected to the smart belt which is the CPU.

The needleless micro injectors will inject energy into the human cells. 
The kit is integrated with billions of those injectors which is directly in contact with human cells. 
The best part is you can decide what to have. If you are lacking with vitamin B, 
you can choose to have it along with the basic nutrition  through the smart belt.

The kit is able to produce all the necessary energy and foods that a human need, so eating foods will be not required anymore. With that, travelling in deserts, and space travelling will be much easier. All it needs is sunlight and humidity.
As a biproduct, the kit can produce Oxygen, which will increase the oxygen amount in atmosphere.
It is a walking tree and with each human with one kit, it will be 8 billion more trees to the nature in 2070.
